A sample of coding in the programming language in R with projects I have undertaken as self study to better understand the language and its capibilities. R is my favorite programming language and I find its package ecosystem, particularly within the tidyverse, incredibly powerful in statistical analysis. 

In these files I explore ideas and concepts such as: EDA, feature engineering, Stratified cross-fold validation for better sampling, ML algorithms, and more.
